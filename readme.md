# Brain Tumor Classification


This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain tumors using MRI images. The model is trained to classify images into four categories: No Tumor, Pituitary, Glioma, Meningioma

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to classify brain MRI images. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional, batch normalization, max-pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset available on Kaggle. It contains MRI images for training and testing the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit


## Training
The training script preprocesses the images, defines the model architecture, and trains the model.

1. **Preprocessing:** Images are resized and normalized.
2. **Model Architecture:** Defined in `model.py`.
3. **Training Loop:** Defined in the notebook with performance metrics.



## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on a validation set, and the best-performing model is saved. The evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss.


### Functionality:

1. **Model Loading**: The pre-trained model is loaded automatically upon accessing the app.
2. **Image Upload**: Users can upload MRI images directly to the app interface.
3. **Prediction Display**: Once an image is uploaded, the app displays the predicted tumor type based on the model's classification.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 87.6% on the test set. Training and validation loss and accuracy plots are provided to visualize the model's performance. Confusion matrices illustrate the classification performance on the test set.
